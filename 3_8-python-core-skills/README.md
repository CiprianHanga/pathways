Python is a multi-use programming language that is most often used to build the back-end of web applications, or to carry out data analysis. We'll focus on it's use as a web back-end.

Python emphasizes simplicity, clarity, and readability. If your first language was from the C family (C, C++, Java, or Javascript) then you'll find Python easier to read and simpler in many ways. In fact, it's often used intro to computer science classes for this reason.

Python is used all over the web, including as all or a portion of apps by YouTube, Dropbox, Google, Instagram, and Spotify.

Python web applications are typically built on a framework such as Django or Flask, which will provide much of the structure of the app, and make common tasks much easier. Your project will need to be built on a framework, so you'll learn one of these before moving on. More advanced learners may want to dig into the various frameworks to consider the pros and cons (laid out in articles such as [this one](https://www.airpair.com/python/posts/django-flask-pyramid)). If you're not sure, or just want to get started without agonizing over choices, learn Django.

Tackle these tasks, and then you'll be ready to build an amazing Python web project!

### Tasks
* Learn Python language basics
    * Basic syntax
    * Flow control (loops and conditionals)
    * Data structures: Lists, Dictionaries
    * Modules
    * Classes and Objects
* Learn Django basics (or another Python framework)

### Time Commitment

The time to learn these tasks can be highly variable, depending on which resources you use, how many hours per week you are able to devote to learning, and what type of support you have (online via message boards, in-person at meetups, etc). Focus on learning all of these topics, rather than hitting the specified number of hours.
