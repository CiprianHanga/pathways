Once you complete the skills track milestone, you will see skill-specific content here.

The capstone project is one of the most important pieces of landing the perfect LaunchCode apprenticeship. Your project is one of the primary ways that the LaunchCode evaluation team will verify that you're job-ready, and it should be something that you're proud to show off to a potential employer. So don't skimp on the time, energy, and thought that you put into this!

Be unique, innovative and creative. Your project should demonstrate meaningful thought and planning, and that you can build software from the ground up.

We look for for projects that:

1. __Demonstrate marketable skills__: You have a strong foundation in at least one language that is widely used by professional developers, and the related tools and best practices (this includes languages in the skills milestones).
2. __Demonstrate your ability to learn new things__: You've gone beyond your initial learning to teach yourself something new. Maybe you learned Angular.js for your front-end web project, or customized the UI components of your mobile project.
3. __Demonstrate utility for a company__: In order to land that perfect job, a prospective employer will want to know that even as a newer programmer, you're capable of creating high-quality work for them.

Put your project up in GitHub. This will make it accessible for others to view, and will show off all of hard work you put into it as you rack up commits!

Regardless of the project you tackle, you should:
* Build an application entirely yourself, or nearly so. If you use â€œstarter code" or a group project, you need to go well beyond what was provided or worked on by others. You should be able to clearly articulate what you built yourself versus what was built or provided by others.
* Include 3-5 killer features. The example projects below will give you an idea of what constitutes a solid feature. Adding a new button to your web project? Probably not significant enough. Adding user authentication? Yep, that's great!


### Time Commitment

The time to complete your project will may vary quite a bit from our estimate of 150 hours. You should focus on making a great product, and on hitting the objectives listed above. In addition, as you go through the LaunchCode application process, our evaluation team may have some suggestions on how to make your project even better.
