Exposure to coding provides learners with a basis for deciding to make a commitment to a more intensive and demanding class, or for deciding to buy a new laptop. Additionally, LaunchCode has found that individuals with even minimal exposure, such as a few hours of online tutorials, have a much higher likelihood of being successful in intensive courses.

Hello, World! is LaunchCode's in-person exposure-to-coding class, and it provides additional background on the path to a career in tech and the LaunchCode apprenticeship process. If you are unable to take this class in-person, you'll find a lot of information on our [Apply](https://www.launchcode.org/apply) and [FAQ](https://www.launchcode.org/faq) pages.

*Note:* Experience with HTML and CSS *does not* constitute completion of this learning objective. These are static languages, and differ greatly from languages that rely on series of commands to carry out actions, known as *imperative programming*.

### Tasks
* Complete a short, beginner-oriented coding course online or in-person

### Time Commitment

*Up to 20 hours*

This milestone should not be intensive, or take a large amount of time. It will not give you skills at any level needed for a tech job, but it will lay the foundation for the more intensive stages of learning ahead, and will make sure you are ready to commit to the larger educational objectives that are ahead.
