Basic skills in and comfort with math concepts are necessary for learning programming and computer science. Aptitude in math also overlaps with the logic and problem-solving skills that are necessary to be successful in a career in technology.

Programming doesn't require advanced math skills, but comfort with the following concepts is something that all programmers possess. Many introductory programming classes will teach binary and hexadecimal representation of numbers, and may review concepts such as modular arithmetic or logarithms.

### Core Skills
* Arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division (including remainders, modulo, even/odd)
* Integers and floats
* Percentages and representation of percentages as decimal numbers
* Logarithms and exponents
* Number systems: decimal, binary, hexadecimal
* Problem solving

### Time Commitment

*Up to 50 hours*

Most individuals will benefit from at least a review of these concepts, which may take only 1-5 hours. Others may need to take a class or more in-depth review if there are larger gaps in knowledge.

Yet others may be able to simply review these concepts as they go, if it's simply been a while since they last used them.
