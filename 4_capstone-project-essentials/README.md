Before you start working on a project in your chosen skill area, you'll need to add a few tools to your toolbox.

### Git and GitHub

Git is a widely-used version control system. Version control systems allow developers to keep track of changes in their code, collaborate with other developers, and create different versions of the same application for different purposes. While there are systems other than Git, Git is the best system for you to learn first.

Choose one of the introductory Git tutorials to get started. Then, create an account and create your first project in GitHub.

One feature of GitHub is that it serves as a sort of â€œcoding resume", allowing the LaunchCode evaluation team and potential employers to see what you've built, so they can be confident in your skills as a programmer. So create a profile with accurate information, including a nice, high-quality photo of yourself, and add each new project you create to GitHub. Rack up those commits, and your profile will look like that of a pro in no time!

### Unix Command-Line Tools

*Note: This learning objective does not apply to Windows users.*

If you're working in Mac OS X or Linux, you should be comfortable using a command line (aka shell or terminal) to navigate your computer's file system and run programs. Doing so exposes additional power and capabilities of your computer, which you'll be able to leverage as a developer.

Some tasks, such as using Git, can be done via either the command-line or a GUI tool. At this stage of your learning, you may use whichever approach is more comfortable in your day-to-day work. However, you should know the basics of using the command-line and being able to carry out basic tasks if needed.

You should learn the following Unix commands and operators: `ls`, `cd`, `grep`, `less`, `cat`, `pwd`, `history`, `|` (pipe), `..` (dot-dot), `~` (tilde), `man`, `mv`, `mkdir`, `rm`

If you're enjoying the command-line experience, here are some more tools to learn that can be very useful to developers: `ps`, `ssh`, `wget`, `sudo`

### Getting Help and Finding Answers
As you progress in your path toward being a professional developer, you'll learn to be more independent in your learning and problem solving. In fact, you've probably already gotten pretty good at looking for answers to your problems online.

#### Online resources
There are many online communities of developers that focus on various languages and platforms. [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) and [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com) are good places to start.

As always, when trying to solve a problem, follow the read-search-ask model:
* __Read__ the error message, and learn as much as you can from the message.
* __Search__ the internet using phrases describing your problem, or even useful chunks of the error message.
* __Ask__ somebody! Use one of the online resources above to post your question, or find a meetup to join where other knowledgeable programmers can help you over your hump.

#### In-person resources
If you live in a city, then you'll likely have easy access to meetup groups that can provide a supportive community as you learn to code. Some meetups are language- or platform-specific (such as STLRuby, a Ruby meetup in St. Louis) and some are more open (such as Code Till Dawn in St. Louis). Join [meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com) and find a meetup to go to this month!

### Tasks
* Learn Git
* Create a GitHub account and complete your profile
* Practice basic Unix command line tools
* Join meetup.com and attend a meetup

### Time Commitment

Approximately 10 hours. Don't worry about mastering Git/GitHub or command-line tools at this time. Instead, you should just become familiar with the basics, and find a few resources and references that you like. You'll master these tools through repeated use while working your capstone project, and beyond.
