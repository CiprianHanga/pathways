Live coding is the exercise of writing code during an interview or evaluation, either directly on a computer or on a whiteboard. This is a common part of interviews with employers, as well as being a key part of the LaunchCode apprenticeship interview.

Live coding gives you a chance to demonstrate your ability to solve problems and think on your feet, while giving LaunchCode or a potential employer a chance to see how you work through problems.

The resources provided here give you a chance to work on bite-sized problems in a way that simulates live coding. If you have friend or family member that's a programmer, practicing with them can also be useful.

### Time Commitment

*Average of 10 hours*

You should spend as much time on this as you need to become comfortable live coding and solving problems on your feet. For some people this will take extended practice and time, while for others it may come more naturally.
