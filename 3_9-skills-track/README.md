Once you complete the Core Coding Skills objective, you will be ready to apply your knowledge of those universal programming concepts to learning a language that will be oriented toward your desired type of programming job, and in which you will build your capstone project.

### Time Commitment

* Average of 150 hours*

The time to learn a core skill can be highly variable, depending on which resources you use, how many hours per week you are able to devote to learning, and what type of support you have (online via message boards, in-person at meetups, etc). Focus on learning all of these topics, rather than hitting the specified number of hours. That said, we estimate that it will take most learners an average of 150 hours to complete this learning task.
